### Project Description
A book sharing system is a way for people to lend and borrow books from one another, often through a community or library network. It helps make books accessible to more people without needing to buy them. Participants can exchange books they‚Äôve already read for new ones, promoting reading and saving money. This system encourages sharing, reduces waste, and creates a sense of connection among people who enjoy reading. It's a simple and effective way to make literature available to everyone, regardless of financial resources.

### The Problem statement
problem being solved is the unused book clutter in people's homes, offices, and libraries, while simultaneously offering a solution to the absurd waste of resources in constantly purchasing books that could easily be shared or exchanged.
